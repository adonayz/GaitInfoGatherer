# GaitInfoGatherer
A survey application that collects the user's gait data using accelerometer and gyroscope sensors. The Gait data is measured across different BAC levels and is analyzed.

The project was not completed. The attempt to use the ResearchStack platform to create a gait data gathering wasted too much time. The project was rebuilt from scratch wihout using ResearchStack. The following link leads to the new application:
